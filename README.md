## Vulture

A crawler engine based on Scrapy. I'm writing this to design a MVP (minimum viable product) for my upcoming venture, [HayAuto](http://hayauto.com/).

This a *trial*, and will not be supported after some time. I will be writing a fully custom engine using Scala + Akka when I feel the time is right.

The goals of the Scala implementation are:

* Easy to configure: the options for this are either YAML/JSON or a custom DSL
* Easy to scale
* Distributable
* Highly fault tolerant
* Easy to extend

Anyways, enjoy!
